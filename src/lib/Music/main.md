## Noisy stuff

When I'm coding I listen to music and when I'm not coding I try to play some music. In these pages I try to keep useful or interesting resources I have gathered from my researches.

### [Chords](/chords/)

A list of song chords I took from the internet or made by myself and like to play.

### [Production](https://soundcloud.com/statox/tracks)

I post some of the music I make [on soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/statox/tracks).

### [Guitar](/guitar/)

I've been playing the guitar for 10+ years now but I had never made the efforts to learn music theory properly until recently.

### [Pedals](/pedals/)

Sometimes I play my guitar with a pedalboard I'm putting together. Here I keep some user manuals, some sample settings and probaly more stuff in the future.

### [Documents](/user_manuals/)

The user manuals for my gear as well as some PDF documents about music and electronics.

### [Cool covers](/coolcovers/)

One of my weird obsession is cover songs. I try to write a bit about my discoveries.
