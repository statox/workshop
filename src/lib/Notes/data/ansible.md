### Run a command on several hosts

The documentation [Introduction to Ad Hoc commands](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_adhoc.html) is a great reference.

1. In the inventory file create the list of servers to target
```yml
[my_target_group_name]
host01.domain.ext
host02.domain.ext
host03.domain.ext
```

2. Run the command
```bash
ansible [target_group_name] -i path/to/inventory/file -m shell -a [your_command]

# Example
ansible my_target_group_name -i inventories/inventory -m shell -a 'df -h'
```

The module `shell` allows to run any shell command but one can use [any module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/index_module.html)

If you need to become root to run the command pass `--become` to the `ansible` command.
