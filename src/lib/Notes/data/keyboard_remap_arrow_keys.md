[title]: # 'Remap <alt>+hjkl to arrow keys on Linux'

One way to have <kbd>alt</kbd><kbd>h</kbd>, <kbd>alt</kbd><kbd>j</kbd>, <kbd>alt</kbd><kbd>k</kbd>, <kbd>alt</kbd><kbd>l</kbd> mapped to arrow keys is to use [autokey](https://github.com/autokey/autokey).

_Note that autokey is an X11 app that will not work with Wayland_

On Ubuntu 21.04 one can install autokey from the repos with `sudo apt install autokey-gtk`.
In autokey one can create four different scripts with the following content:

```python
# script arrow_left
keyboard.send_keys("<left>")

# script arrow_right
keyboard.send_keys("<right>")

# script arrow_up
keyboard.send_keys("<up>")

# script arrow_down
keyboard.send_keys("<down>")
```

Then on each script set a hotkey (The "Press to set" feature is useful to set combinations like <kbd>alt</kbd><kbd>h</kbd>):
